Understanding the basics of [git version control](http://git-scm.com/) is a natural progression
into using Github.  The learning curve for git is extremely
high and git abstractions take time to understand. _We don't have time._  In this course
I hope to avoid deep discussions on version control because, currently, most archetypes of
research scientists have little need for [version control](# "In computer software
engineering, revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides
control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision
control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code.").

> More of [Version Control Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)

My intention is teach the collaborative tools provided by Github for software development
and apply them research science.  Github is a fantastic place to build tools, ideas,
and projects with others.  This is the intent of research science and we are going to use Github for just that.

> My Opinion: No scientists needs version control until they have used it.  Version control has frustrated
me for weeks on end, but there have been times when it has saved me weeks of man hours fixing unforunate blunders in my code.
I suggest taking the time to learn to integrate version control for research
code development.

## So... What is Github then?

### Why is it Awesome?

Github is an open source software collaboration tool that provides great free services to its users.
A healthy combination of Github and _select_ external services can provide an efficient
[centralized stack for scientific research](http://materials-informatics-lab.github.io/week-1/2014/08/19/Time-is-not-a-friend.html).
Github notification and reply services support a wide array of users who like to use
[Software as a Service](https://github.com), [Command Line Prompts](https://hub.github.com/), and [email clients](https://github.com/blog/811-reply-to-comments-from-email).

I contend that the most important feature of Github for Research Science are Github Pages
combined with the Jekyll engine that interprets its contents.

#### Blog Aware Publishing

> Publication does not refer to peer reviewed publication.  I am referring to anything
that is used to present data, software, or knowledge about a research project.
This layer includes discussions, PDFâ€™s, slideshows, code, binary files, etc.

I am often hesitant to use describe a blog aware approach to research science as Publication.  I interpret the publication/presentation layer as anything that is used to present data, software, or knowledge about a research project.  This layer includes discussions, PDF's, slideshows, code, binary files, etc.  The presentation layer can aggregate information and workflows associated with pieces of data and software.  A real time progress of research persists and innovation becomes more apparent.

The presentation layer for research science is provided by Github pages using a special branch of the repository.  This branch of the repository is transparent to other branches which may contain codes and data pertaining to the project.

Other branches may support access to codes and data.
