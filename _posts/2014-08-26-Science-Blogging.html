## Science Blogging versus Research Blogging

The goal of science blogging to disseminate results to the general public.
Research blogging shares results with other domain experts and specialists.  The content that is shared
in popular and research science are completely different ideas.

## Gists

As a researcher, programmer, and data scientist, Github Gists satisfy most of my needs to share
small pieces of information.  Often I present content as a combination of code and documents.  Gists (and all
Github editors) use the [ACE editor](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about "High Performance Code Editor for the Web")
which provides [syntax highlighting](http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/2010/11/syntax-highlighting-specification.html)
for a 110 languages.

Providing a Gist with an {% raw %}``filename.ext``{% endraw %} will activate
syntax highlighting for that {% raw %}``ext``{% endraw %}. (e.g. {% raw %}``file.py``{% endraw %} would activate
Python syntax highlighting.)
